    <h1>Be Inspired</h1>
    <p>
        Get in there and get out with some of the stuff. Let other people sit there and thinking they can remember it all. Let other people treat opportunities casually <strong>but not YOU</strong>. I would asked you to treat it <strong>SERIOUSLY</strong>. Let other people wonder at the end of their life where it all went wrong but NOT you. Let other people play while you work, fool around while you study, soak up the sun while you soak up <strong>IDEAS</strong>. Ten years from now they will still figuring out how to pay the bill, <strong>but NOT you</strong>. Life always reward the serious students for their labors.
